\textbf{Machine Learning Engineer} | {\color{companygrey}Summit Innovation} | {\color{dategrey}01/2020 – 03/2022}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Led the effort to build the AI component of the company's drive-through queue management system. I developed \& deployed a deep-learning-based object detection algorithm to detect, localize, and track vehicles across the drive-through lane.
    \item Developed deep learning models for computer vision use cases (classification, object detection, and segmentation) and engineered a model registry for API access using Git and DVC.
    \item Created the company's first data acquisition solution for extracting, processing, and storing images from hundreds of CCTV cameras across restaurants in Australia and North America. Implemented robust cloud storage and version control systems that ensured data integrity, change tracking, and team collaboration.
    \item Collaborated with the company's top management to document R\&D efforts and progress for government research grant applications.
