\textbf{Senior Machine Learning Engineer} | {\color{companygrey}Powercor} | {\color{dategrey}03/2022 – 08/2024}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Built an AI system that automated the inspection of power distribution assets, resulting in a 1000x speed increase, improved assessment accuracy, and significant cost savings. The system integrates deep learning, computer vision, and heuristics in a multistage pipeline.
    \item Engineered robust, self-contained pipelines for reproducible model training experiments, production inferencing, and ETL data processing.
    \item Developed CI/CD pipelines for iterative deployment and monitoring of ML models and data solutions in public clouds - enhancing efficiency and scalability.
    \item Developed automated tools to monitor and report on model performance, identifying and addressing performance degradation or data anomalies as the data evolves in production.
    \item Collaborated with stakeholders to develop multiple POCs for advanced analytics initiatives aimed at enhancing data-driven decision-making and process automation - including building an RAG/LLM solution that leveraged internal PDF manuals hastening access to information and improving workflow.
