\begin{itemize}
    \item Led the AI enhancement of the airport bag-drop system by developing a deep-learning model to detect luggage with straps that could disrupt aircraft loading. The system prompts travellers to place such luggage in plastic tubs, improving reliability, reducing personnel intervention, and speeding up check-in times.
    \item Developed guidelines for various annotation tasks and engaged external contractors to securely label the data, thereby creating versatile data resources for the company.
    \item Reporting directly to the CTO, I initiated a broad range of research initiatives with potent POCs and contributed to strategic planning, business development, proposal writing, and product development.
